# library
Library project from TOP

I started coding the UI and at the time of coding the script I realised I was a bit ambitious. But I will still do my best to get everything done. It shouldnt be too hard.

The biggest problem will be interacting with the DOM, since I need a way to move books on the DOM by dragging elements, and then sort them in different places by changing the book's object properties.
