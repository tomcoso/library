I started coding the UI layout and ideas and at the time of coding the script I realised I was a bit ambitious. But I will still do my best to get everything done. It shouldnt be too hard.

The biggest problem will be interacting with the DOM, since I need a way to move books on the DOM by dragging elements, and then sort them in different places by changing the book's object properties.

Since this project is focused on the JavaScript aspect i will not be spending a lot of time in making a visually compelling UI. But rather developing the features and learning about organising code in objects and object's prorotypes.
